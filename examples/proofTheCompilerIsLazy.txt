# This is a program which parses and runs correctly, but only because of how many shortcuts the compiler takes.
# To fix this, one would need to reserve keywords and operators, and check the validity of variable names.
# Furthermore, the parser should validate whether each line ends where it thinks it does, instead of discarding any remaining tokens blindly.
# Many of these kind of shortcuts would be extremely bad practice in an actual compiler, but these shortcuts were taken to write it within the timeframe of a single hackathon.
