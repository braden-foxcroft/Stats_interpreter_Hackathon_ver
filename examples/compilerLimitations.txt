# This is a program which parses and runs correctly, but only because of how many shortcuts we took in the compiler design. (since we wrote it during a time-pressured hackathon.)
# To fix this, one would need to properly reserve keywords and operators, and check the validity of variable names.
# Furthermore, the parser should validate whether each line ends where it thinks it does, instead of discarding any remaining tokens blindly.

pass works fine, but does not check where the line ends - this is why we can have an unmatched close bracket on line 9
