# What are the odds that 100 coin tosses will yield 70 heads?
# consider using '-p' to show the answer in percentage form, though the exact answer is ((100 pick 70) / 2^100)
# This also shows the 'unify' behavior: execution pathes with the same sum will join and become the same path, adding their probabilities.


set sum = 0
for i in 1 to 100
	select toss from 0,1
	set sum = sum + toss
	discard toss

if sum == 70
	pass
fail
